# Info Toast Memos

Memos is an application designed to use GitHub gists to share memos, while being able to see when people have joined.

It is accessible at <a href="https://infotoast.org/memos/">infotoast.org/memos</a>

You can use this on your own server, but it is multi-user and accessible from the main website, and would require some code modifications to get it to run on other sites.
